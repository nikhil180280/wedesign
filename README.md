# 🌐 Learning Full-Stack Development — My Public Practice Repository

Welcome to my public learning repository! 🚀

This space is where I **practice, experiment, and grow** as a **beginner full-stack developer**. Since I don’t have a laptop available in college, I use **GitHub as my primary workspace** — updating my code, learning materials, and small projects directly from campus. 💻🏫

## 🔰 About Me (Beginner Developer)

I am currently learning **web development from scratch**, starting with:

* 🧱 **HTML** — building the structure
* 🎨 **CSS** — styling and layout
* 🧠 **Basic UI/UX** — clean and simple user interfaces
* 🌐 **GitHub workflow** — pushing code, version control, and project organization

My journey is slow but consistent, and this repository helps me stay accountable. ✨
